Where Anti-Alpha all began... (at least v1.0)
# Welcome!
Welcome to the Anti-Alpha Github. It's just this page for now, but more will be added in the future.

# What even is this?
Anti-Alpha is an esoteric language designed to avoid the use of alphabetic characters as much as possible, while still being a golfing language. The only place that [a - z, A - Z] (which I will call !) are used is in strings and comments (trust me, you'll need them there). It is intended to circumvent restricions on ! or characters in ! while allowing functionality. The entirety of the commands will be documented here.
