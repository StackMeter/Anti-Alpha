Where Anti-Alpha all began... (at least v1.0)
# Welcome!
Welcome to the Anti-Alpha Github. It's just this page for now, but more will be added in the future.

# What even is this?
Anti-Alpha is an esoteric language designed to avoid the use of alphabetic characters as much as possible, while still being a golfing language. The only place that [a - z, A - Z] (which I will call !) are used is in strings and comments (trust me, you'll need them there). It is intended to circumvent restricions on ! or characters in ! while allowing functionality. The entirety of the commands will be documented here.

# What does this interpeter do (when it's finally done?)

The interpreter takes apart your commands, figures out what it needs to do based on that, and then it executes the code. This is as simple as it gets; most characters are one byte and can do more than one thing, but becuase of this parser, things must end in `/n`, `#` or `Â¦`. Why not the `|`? The `|` is either split left on right, or..., well, or.

# What are the intended updates?

I hope to add access to libraries, such as math. I got my greasy fingers on the Unicode symbol set and there's like, >300 of them, so I might implement some two byters in future.
